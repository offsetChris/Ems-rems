# Ems, Rems, and Flexible interface demo site

This is a demo site to experiment with ems, rems and other relative CSS measurement units. 

[The GitHub page](https://offsetchris.github.io/Ems-rems/) is a space to try it out for yourself!

In the text fields type in the sizes including units for *font-size* *width* and *height*. There is a checkbox to hide or show the computed width and height in each display box to better try out the width and height features. 

Make sure to include units in the fields like: `20px` or `3em`

Run this locally with somethink like `python3 -m http.server 8080` in your terminal (mac)
